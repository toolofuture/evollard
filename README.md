**Quantum Art Authentication Service**

e-Vollard is a mobile-first web application that simulates quantum-powered art authentication. Named after the legendary art dealer Ambroise Vollard, this service combines 19th-century art expertise with cutting-edge quantum computing aesthetics.

## Features

- 📸 **Photo Upload**: Capture or upload artwork images
- 🔬 **Quantum Analysis**: Simulated deep learning authentication process
- ✅ **Verdict System**: Authentic vs. Forgery detection
- 💳 **Payment Integration**: Secure payment flow (simulation)
- 🎨 **Premium Design**: Dark quantum-themed UI with gold accents

## Live Demo

Visit: `https://toolofuture.github.io/evollard/`

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure
- **CSS3**: Custom animations, gradients, glassmorphism
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No dependencies
- **Google Fonts**: Playfair Display + JetBrains Mono

## Local Development

## Design Philosophy

**"Vollard's Voice"**: The application embodies a persona that is both a classical art connoisseur and a quantum computing expert. Every UI element, from typography to color choice, reinforces this duality:

- **Gold (#d4af37)**: Heritage, value, artistry
- **Cyan (#00f3ff)**: Quantum, technology, precision
- **Dark Mode**: Gallery ambiance

## Simulation Details

This is a **demonstration application**. The following features are simulated:

- Art authentication analysis
- Payment processing
- Transaction IDs

No real AI, quantum computing, or payment processing is involved.
